# Pogicity

An isometric city builder engine built with Phaser 3 and Next.js. Place buildings, lay roads, and watch citizens and cars roam your city.

This is a foundation for building isometric strategy games—city builders, tycoon games, RTS, or anything that needs a tile-based isometric world.

## Features

- **Isometric Rendering** - Classic 2:1 isometric projection with proper depth sorting
- **Building System** - Place multi-tile buildings with 4-direction rotation support
- **Road Network** - Auto-connecting roads with proper intersection handling
- **Animated Characters** - GIF-based walking animations in 4 directions
- **Vehicles** - Cars that drive along roads
- **Save/Load** - Persist your city to localStorage
- **Multiple Tile Types** - Grass, asphalt, snow, and more
- **Building Categories** - Residential, commercial, civic, landmarks, props, and seasonal (Christmas!)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

## How the Isometric System Works

### The Basics

Isometric projection creates a 3D-like view from 2D sprites. This engine uses **2:1 isometric** (also called "true isometric" or "dimetric"), where:

- Tiles are diamond-shaped, **44x22 pixels**
- The X-axis goes down-right
- The Y-axis goes down-left
- Depth (what's in front) is determined by position

### Coordinate Conversion

Converting between grid coordinates (x, y) and screen pixels:

```typescript
// Grid → Screen
function gridToScreen(gridX: number, gridY: number) {
  return {
    screenX: (gridX - gridY) * (TILE_WIDTH / 2),
    screenY: (gridX + gridY) * (TILE_HEIGHT / 2)
  };
}

// Screen → Grid
function screenToGrid(screenX: number, screenY: number) {
  return {
    gridX: Math.floor(screenX / TILE_WIDTH + screenY / TILE_HEIGHT),
    gridY: Math.floor(screenY / TILE_HEIGHT - screenX / TILE_WIDTH)
  };
}
```

### Depth Sorting

The key to isometric rendering is drawing things in the right order. Objects further "back" (higher up on screen) must be drawn first.

```typescript
// Basic depth formula
depth = (gridX + gridY) * DEPTH_MULTIPLIER;

// With layer offsets for different object types:
// 0.00 - Ground tiles
// 0.03 - Back fences
// 0.05 - Buildings
// 0.06 - Props/trees
// 0.10 - Cars
// 0.20 - Characters
```

### Multi-Tile Buildings

Large buildings occupy multiple grid cells but are rendered as a single sprite anchored at their "origin" tile (typically the front corner).

```typescript
interface BuildingDefinition {
  footprint: { width: number; height: number };
  sprites: {
    south: string;  // Default facing
    north?: string;
    east?: string;
    west?: string;
  };
}
```

### Sprite Standards

Building sprites follow these conventions:
- **Canvas size:** Typically 512x512 or larger
- **Anchor point:** Front corner at bottom-center of canvas
- **Naming:** `{width}x{height}{name}_{direction}.png`
  - Example: `4x4bookstore_south.png`

### Vertical Slicing (Tall Buildings)

Very tall buildings can cause depth sorting issues when characters walk "behind" them. The solution is to slice the sprite into horizontal strips and give each strip a different depth:

```typescript
// Slice a tall building into strips
for (let slice = 0; slice < numSlices; slice++) {
  const sliceDepth = baseDepth + (slice * 0.001);
  // Render slice at sliceDepth
}
```

## Build Your Own Game

This engine is designed as a starting point. Here are some directions you could take it:

### City Builder (SimCity-style)
- Add zoning (residential/commercial/industrial)
- Implement population and demand simulation
- Create budget and tax systems
- Add city services (police, fire, hospitals)

### Tycoon Game
- Add economy and resource management
- Create customer/visitor AI
- Implement business progression
- Add scenarios and challenges

### RTS (Real-Time Strategy)
- Add unit selection and control
- Implement pathfinding for units
- Create combat systems
- Add fog of war

### 4X Strategy
- Add turn-based mechanics
- Implement tech trees
- Create diplomacy systems
- Add procedural map generation

### Colony Sim
- Add needs-based AI for citizens
- Implement job and task systems
- Create survival mechanics
- Add seasons and weather

## Adding Buildings

Buildings are defined in `app/data/buildings.ts`:

```typescript
"my-building": {
  id: "my-building",
  name: "My Building",
  category: "commercial",
  footprint: { width: 2, height: 2 },
  sprites: {
    south: "/Building/commercial/2x2my_building_south.png",
    north: "/Building/commercial/2x2my_building_north.png",
    east: "/Building/commercial/2x2my_building_east.png",
    west: "/Building/commercial/2x2my_building_west.png",
  },
  icon: "🏢",
  supportsRotation: true,
}
```

## Creating Your Own Assets

Want to make your own isometric buildings? Here's a modern AI-assisted pipeline:

### 1. Generate Concept Art
Use an image generation model to create your building concept. Look for models that handle architecture well.

**Tools:** Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or specialized models like [Nano Banana](https://replicate.com/fofr/nanobanana)

**Tips:**
- Prompt for "isometric view" or "3/4 view"
- Specify architectural style (Victorian, modern, brutalist, etc.)
- Include "game asset" or "video game building" for cleaner results

### 2. Convert to 3D
Turn your 2D concept into a 3D model. This gives you the ability to render from any angle consistently.

**Tools:**
- [Trellis](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS) - Microsoft's image-to-3D
- [Hunyuan3D](https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-1) - Tencent's image-to-3D
- Tripo, Meshy, or other image-to-3D services

### 3. Render Isometric Sprites
Set up your camera at the correct isometric angle and render out sprites for each direction.

**Tools:**
- [PixelOver](https://pixelover.io/) - Great for pixel art style renders
- Blender - Free, full control over rendering
- Any 3D software with orthographic camera support

**Camera setup for 2:1 isometric:**
- Orthographic projection
- 30° rotation from top-down
- 90° rotation for each cardinal direction (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)

### 4. Post-Processing
Clean up your renders and ensure consistency:
- Match the color palette of existing assets
- Add shadows/ambient occlusion if needed
- Ensure transparent backgrounds
- Check that the anchor point aligns with the grid

### Sprite Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Tile size | 44x22 pixels |
| Canvas size | 512x512 (or larger for big buildings) |
| Anchor point | Bottom-center (front corner of building) |
| Format | PNG with transparency |
| Directions | South (required), North/East/West (optional) |

The source code is MIT licensed - use it however you like.

### Art Assets (Buildings, Props, Tiles)
The art assets in this repository are provided for **learning, demos, and prototyping**. Some assets were created for this project, others are from commercial asset packs with varying licenses.

**If you're releasing a game**, you should create or commission your own art assets to avoid any licensing issues.

### Characters
The character sprites (walking GIFs in `/public/Characters/`) are **NOT included in the open source license**. These are proprietary characters.

**You may:**
- Use them for demos, prototypes, and learning
- Use them in non-commercial projects
- Reference them for creating your own characters

**You may NOT:**
- Include them in published/released games
- Redistribute them separately
- Use them in commercial products

If you're building a game for release, please create or commission your own character sprites.
